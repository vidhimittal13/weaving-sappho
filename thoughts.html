            <p>
                My name is Vidhi. I'm 20 years old. I'm studying Computer Science and Economics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>In the early weeks of our philosophy class, we were introduced to the concept of intertextuality, a term that would later become the cornerstone of my project, "Weaving Sappho." This project, encompassing a website and a Twitter bot, is a dive into the philosophical quandary: Is filling in Sappho's fragments an act of creation or destruction?</p>

<p>The website, a digital tapestry of Sappho's poetry fragments and an interactive canvas, was designed to allow users to rearrange these fragments or fill them in with their own words. This feature was a direct nod to intertextuality, highlighting how texts converse with each other and with us, across time and space. Here, Sappho's ancient verses met modern minds, creating a dialogue that was both enriching and unsettling.</p>

<p>On one hand, the project was an exciting journey into the realm of creative speculation. Imagining what Sappho's incomplete poems might have said felt like a thrilling exercise. It was akin to being a detective in a historical whodunnit, piecing together clues to uncover a lost literary treasure. However, this imaginative liberty came with its own set of moral dilemmas. As I toyed with these fragments, I couldn’t shake off the discomfort of imposing my own words onto Sappho's. It felt akin to walking into someone's unfinished symphony and boldly playing a few notes of my own – a sweet melody or a discordant intrusion?</p>

<p>This duality was further exemplified in the Twitter bot. While it was a marvel to see Sappho's fragments take on new life through public engagement, it also raised questions about the ethics of such creative liberties. It's one thing to doodle in the margins of your own notebook, quite another to scribble on a parchment that's survived millennia.</p>

<p>I coded both platforms from scratch. I faced plenty of technical challenges, from the coding intricacies to the character constraints of Twitter. My quest for solutions led me down the paths of academic consultations and brainstorming sessions – think Herculean tasks, but with more coffee and less divine intervention.</p>

<p>Through this project, I realized that engaging with Sappho's fragments was both an act of creation and destruction. It was a thrilling intellectual exercise to let my imagination roam the Aegean Sea with Sappho, but equally, it felt like an intrusion into her poetic realm. Imagine, if you will, Sappho in the 21st century, scrolling through Twitter only to find her fragments dressed up in modern garb – I wonder if she'd retweet with a bemused emoji or block me for artistic insolence?</p>

<p>In conclusion, "Weaving Sappho" emerged as a project balanced precariously on the line between literary exploration and philosophical inquiry. It challenged traditional boundaries, inviting participants to reflect on their role in the act of reimagining history. This project, in its amalgamation of ancient poetry and modern technology, underscored the multifaceted nature of engagement with texts, allowing me to appreciate the richness and complexity of our course material, while also reminding me of the ethical considerations inherent in creative endeavors. </p>
